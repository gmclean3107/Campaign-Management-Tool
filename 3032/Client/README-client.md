This is the frontend of the poject.

Here you will find a controller that communicates with the Server project, Razer pages to be displayed to the user and input validation.
The markup being used is tailwind, this keeps the repository tidier.
When writing any new functionality, the frontend simply makes a call to the backend. There shoould be minimal amounts of logic in the in this project.
