This project is the backend of the System.

Here you will find:

    - A controller that handles the receiving of api calls.
    - A set of services that cover logging, calling functions, and auto deleting expired campaigns.
    - A set of Repository files that handle the logic of all the functions. In here is where communication with the database also occurs.
        - MockCampaignRepository is where any functions that are being tested need to be rewritten in a way that the logic remains the same, but is applied to a set of test data instead of data from the database.
    - The CsvExports folder is there to store the files generated by the ExportToCsv functions. This is in place as a proof of functionality.


To avoid any build errors, ensure that once the function is in the interface, it is implemented in the files that implement the interface.
